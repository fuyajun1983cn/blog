  ## Overview

  * operates in the unlicensed ISM band at 2.4 GHz
  * employs a frequency hopping transceiver to combat interference and fading and provides many FHSS carriers.
  * uses a shaped, binary frequency modulation to minimize transceiver complexity.
  * Basic Rate: supporting 1 Mb/s bit rate.
  * Enhanced Data Rate: supporting a gross air bit rate of 2 or 3Mb/s.

  ## Overview

  * physical radio channel is shared by a group of devices.
  * those devices are synchronized by a common clock and frequency hopping pattern.
  * the device provide the synchronization reference is called as master, others are called as slaves.
  * a group of devices formed a piconet.

  ## Frequency Hopping Pattern

  * a specific frequency hopping pattern is algorithmically determined by certain fields in the Bluetooth address and the clock of the master.
  * The basic hopping pattern is a pseudo-random ordering of the 79 frequencies, separated by 1 MHz, in the ISM band.
  * The Hopping pattern can be adapted on per-salve device basis to exclude some frequencies.

  ## Physical Channel

  * The physical channel is sub-divided into time units known as slots.
  * Data in the packets are transmitted in those slots.
  * Using TDD, bluetooth technology allow the effect of full duplex transmission.

  ## Hierachy of Channels and Links

  * above the physical channel are the layering of links , channels and associated control protocols.
  * From physical channel upward are:
  * physical channel
  * physical link
  * logical transport
  * logical link
  * L2CAP channel

  ## Physical link

  * Typically, a physical link is formed between a master device and slave devices.
  * Inquiry scan & Page scan don't need an associated physical link.
  * Physical link is generally bi-directional transmition except in the case of a Connectionless Slave Broadcast physical link.
  * There is a physical link between each slave and master.
  * NO direct physical links are formed  between slaves.

<section data-markdown>
  ## Physical Link

  * used as a transport for one or more logical links.
  * Logical links support unicast synchronous, asynchronous and isochronous traffic, and broadcast traffic.
  * Traffic on logical links is multiplexed onto the physical link by ocuppying slots.

  ## Link Manager Protocol(LMP)

  * carried over logical links.
  * ACL logical transport are the default asynchronous connection-oriented logical transport used to transport LMP protocol signaling.
  * whenever a device joins a piconet, a primary ACL logical transport is created.
  * Connectionless Slave Broadcast devices are exceptional, they are purely listening to Connectionless Slave Broadcast packets. a Connectionless Slave Broadcast logical transport is created.
  * For all devices, additional logical transports may be created to transport synchronous data streams when required.

<section data-markdown>
  ## Link Manager

  * The Link Manager function uses LMP to control the operation of devices in the piconet.
  * provide services to manage the lower architectural layers(radio layer and baseband layer).
  
</section>
<section data-markdown>
  ## L2CAP

  * provides a channel-based abstraction to applications and services.
  * applicaiton segmentation and reassembly of application data.
  * multiplexing and de-multiplexing of multiple channels over a shared logical link.
  * has a protocol control channel carried over the default ACL logical transport.
  * any logical link supporting L2CAP protocol can carry L2CAP encapsulated data.
