      <ul>
        <li>operates in the unlicensed ISM band at 2.4 GHz</li>
        <li>employs a frequency hopping transceiver to combat interference and fading and provides many FHSS carriers.</li>
        <li>uses a shaped, binary frequency modulation to minimize transceiver complexity.</li>

  <h3>Overview</h3>
  <div class="ppt">
    <ul>
      <li>physical radio channel is shared by a group of devices.</li>
      <li>those devices are synchronized by a common clock and frequency hopping pattern.</li>
      <li>the device provide the synchronization reference is called as <span class="ppt-keyword">master</span>, others are called as <span class="ppt-keyword">slaves</span>.</li>
      <li>a group of devices formed a piconet. </li>
    </ul>

  <h3>Frequency Hopping Pattern</h3>
  <div class="ppt">
    <div class="ppt-left">
      <ul>
        <li>a specific frequency hopping pattern is algorithmically determined by certain fields in the Bluetooth address and the clock of the master.</li>
        <li>The basic hopping pattern is a pseudo-random ordering of the 79 frequencies, separated by 1 MHz, in the ISM band.</li>
      </ul>
    </div>
    <div class="ppt-right">
      <ul>
        <li>The Hopping pattern can be adapted on per-salve device basis to exclude some frequencies.</li>

  ## Physical Channel

  * The physical channel is sub-divided into time units known as slots.
  * Data in the packets are transmitted in those slots.
  * Using TDD, bluetooth technology allow the effect of full duplex transmission.

  <h3>Hierachy of Channels and Links</h3>
  <div class="ppt">
    <div class="ppt-left">
      <ul>
        <li>above the physical channel are the layering of links , channels and associated control protocols.</li>
        <li>From physical channel upward are:</li>
        <ul>
          <li> physical channel</li>
          <li> physical link</li>
          <li> logical transport</li>
          <li> logical link</li>
          <li> L2CAP channel</li>

  <h3>Physical link</h3>
  <div class="ppt">
    <div class="ppt-left">
      <ul>
        <li>Typically, a physical link is formed between a master device and slave devices.</li>
        <li>Inquiry scan & Page scan don't need an associated physical link.</li>
        <li>Physical link is generally bi-directional transmition except in the case of a Connectionless Slave Broadcast physical link.</li>
      </ul>
    </div>
    <div class="ppt-right">
      <ul>
        <li>There is a physical link between each slave and master.</li>
        <li>NO direct physical links are formed  between slaves.</li>
      </ul>
    </div>
</section>
<section data-markdown>
  ## Physical Link

  * used as a transport for one or more logical links.
  * Logical links support unicast synchronous, asynchronous and isochronous traffic, and broadcast traffic.
  * Traffic on logical links is multiplexed onto the physical link by ocuppying slots.

  <h3>Link Manager Protocol(LMP)</h3>
  <div class="ppt">
    <div class="ppt-left">
      <ul>
        <li>carried over logical links.</li>
        <li>ACL logical transport are the default asynchronous connection-oriented logical transport used to transport LMP protocol signaling.</li>
        <li>whenever a device joins a piconet, a primary ACL logical transport is created.</li>
      </ul>
    </div>
    <div class="ppt-right">
      <ul>
        <li>Connectionless Slave Broadcast devices are exceptional, they are purely listening to Connectionless Slave Broadcast packets. a Connectionless Slave Broadcast logical transport is created.</li>
        <li>For all devices, additional logical transports may be created to transport synchronous data streams when required.</li>
      </ul>
    </div>
  </div>

  ## Link Manager

  * The Link Manager function uses LMP to control the operation of devices in the piconet.
  * provide services to manage the lower architectural layers(radio layer and baseband layer).

  <h3>L2CAP</h3>
  <div class="ppt">
    <ul>
      <li>provides a channel-based abstraction to applications and services.</li>
      <li>applicaiton segmentation and reassembly of application data.</li>
      <li>multiplexing and de-multiplexing of multiple channels over a shared logical link.</li>
      <li>has a protocol control channel carried over the default ACL logical transport.</li>
      <li>any logical link supporting L2CAP protocol can carry L2CAP encapsulated data.</li>
    </ul>
