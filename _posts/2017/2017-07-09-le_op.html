  ## Overview   

  * the LE radio operates in the unlicensed 2.4 GHz ISM bannd.
  * The LE system employs a frequency hopping transceiver.
  * LE radio operation uses a shaped, binary frequency modulation to minimize transceiver complexity.

	<div class="ppt-left">
	  <ul>
		<li>The mandatory data rates: 1Mbps.</li>

  <h3>Physical  Channel</h3>
  <div class="ppt">
    <ul>
      <li>The physical channel is sub-divided into time units known as events.</li>
      <li>There are four types of events:</li>
      <ul>
        <li>Advertising</li>
        <li>Extended Advertising</li>
        <li>Periodic Advertising</li>
        <li>Connection</li>
      </ul>
    </ul>

  <h3>Device  Role</h3>
  <div class="ppt">
    <ul>
      <li><span class="ppt-keyword">advertisers</span>.transmit advertising packets on the advertising PHY channels</li>
      <li><span class="ppt-keyword">scanners</span>.receive advertising packets on the advertising channels without the intention to connect to the advertising device</li>
      <li><span class="ppt-keyword">initiators</span>.listen for connectable advertising packets.</li>
    </ul>
  </div>
</section>
<section data-markdown>
  ## Device Role

  * Once a connection is established, the initiator becomes the master device.
  * the advertising device becomes the slave device.
  * Connection events are used to send data packets between the master and slave devices.
  
</section>
<section data-markdown>
  ## Connection Events

  * channel hopping occurs at the start of each connection event.
  * the master and slave alternate sending data packets using the same data PHY channel within a  connection event.
  * the master  initiates the beginning of each connection event  and can end each connection event at any time.

  ## Connection Events

</section>
<section data-markdown>
  ## data hopping pattern

  * in the connection request sent by an  initiating device, a  field will  determine the specific frequency hopping pattern.
  * The hopping  frequency pattern can be adapted to exclude  a  portion of the frequencies.

  <h3>Hierachy of links</h3>
  <div class="ppt">
    <ul>
      <li>the hiearchy above physical channels are:</li>
      <ul>
        <li>physical channel</li>
        <li>physical link</li>
        <li>logical transport</li>
        <li>logical link</li>
        <li>L2CAP channel</li>
      </ul>
    </ul>
  </div>
</section>
<section data-markdown>
  ## Restrictions of Physical Links

  * Within a physical channel, a physical link is formed between devices.
  * There is a physical link between each slave and master.
  * Slaves are permitted to have physical links to more than one master at a time.
</section>
<section data-markdown>
  ## Restrictions of Physical Links
  
  * A device is permitted to be  master and slave at the same time.
  * Physical links are not formed directly between the slaves in a piconet.
  
</section>
<section data-markdown>
  ## Logical link

  * The physical link is used as a transport for one or more logical links that support asynchronous traffic.
  * Traffic on logical links is multiplexed onto the physical link. 
</section>
<section data-markdown>
  ## control protocol

  * carried over logical links
  * This is the link layer protocol (LL).
  * Devices that are active in a piconet have a default LE asynchronous connection logical transport.
  * The default LE ACL is the one that is created whenever a device joins a piconet.
  
</section>
<section data-markdown>
  ## Link Layer

  * The Link Layer function uses the LL protocol to control the operation of devices
  * provide services to manage the lower architectural layers(PHY & LL)

</section>
<section data-markdown>
  ## L2CAP layer

  * provides a channel-based abstraction to applications and services.
  * It carries out fragmentation and de-fragmentation of application data.
  * multiplexing and de-multiplexing of multiple channels over a shared logical link.
  * L2CAP has a protocol control channel that is carried over the primary ACL logical transport.
  
</section>
<section data-markdown>
  ## Security Manager protocol (SMP)

  * reside on top of L2CAP.
  * uses a fixed L2CAP channel to implement the security functions between devices.
  
</section>
<section data-markdown>
  ## Attribute protocol (ATT)

  * provides a method to communicate small amounts of data over a fixed L2CAP channel.
  * also used by devices to determine the services and capabilities of other devices.
  * may also be used over BR/EDR.
