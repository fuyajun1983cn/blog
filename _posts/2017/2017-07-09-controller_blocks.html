<section data-markdown>
  ## Device Manager

  * the functional block in the baseband that controls the general behavior of the Bluetooth device.
  * responsible for all operations not directly related to data transport such as:
  * Inquiry
  * Connect
  * make local device discoverable or connetable.
  
</section>
<section data-markdown>
  ## Device Manager

  * need access to the transport medium to carry out its functions.
  * controls local device behavior by a number of the HCI commands such as:
  * manage local name
  * store link keys.
  * other functionality.
  
</section>
<section data-markdown>
  ## Link Manager

  * responsible for managing logical links(or related logical transports):
  * creation
  * modification
  * release
  * update of parameters related to physical links between devices.
  * using LMP in BR/EDR and LL in LE to achieve the above functions.
  
</section>

  ## Link Manager

  * LM or LL protocol allows:
  * creation of new logical links and logical transports when required.
  * the general control of link and transport attributes such as:
  * enabling of encryption on the logical transport
  * adapting of TX power in BR/EDR on the physical link.
  *adjusting of QoS Settings in  BR/EDR for a logical link.
  
</section>

  ## Baseband Resource Manager

  * responsible for all access to the radio medium.
  * has two main functions:
  * a scheduler that grants time on the physical channels.
  * negotiate access contracts with other entities.
  * An access contract is effectively a commitment to deliver a certain QoS reuirement.
  * realignment time between slots on the original physical channel and slots on the new physical channel.
  
</section>
<section data-markdown>
  ## Link Controller

  * responsible for the encoding and decoding of Bluetooth packets from data payload.
  * and parameters related to the physical channel, logical transport and logical link.
  * carry out link control protocol signaling in BR/EDR and link layer protocol in LE. 
  
</section>
<section data-markdown>
  ## PHY

  * responsible for transmitting and receiving packets of information on the physical channel.
