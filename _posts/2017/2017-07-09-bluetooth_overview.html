  ## What's Bluetooth   

  * a short-range communications system.
  * robustness,lower power consumption and low cost.
  
</section>
<section data-markdown>
  ## Two Forms of Bluetooth Technology

  * Basic Rate(BR) & Low Energy(LE)
  * Both includes
  1. device discovery  
  2. connection establishment  
  3. connection mechanisims

  ## Low Energy(LE)

  * Designed for
  * lower current consumption
  * lower complexity  
  * lower cost than BR/EDR  
  * for use cases with lower data rates & lower duty cycles.

  ## Bluetooth core system

  * Consists of
  * a Host 
  * one or more  Controllers.
  * Host is a logical entity defined as all the layers below the non-core profiles and above the HCI .
  * Controller is defined as  all the layers below the  HCI layers.
  * There are two types of Controllers: Primary Controllers & Secondary Controllers.  
  
</section>
<section data-markdown>
  ## Possible Configurations

  * a BR/EDR Controller including the Radio, Baseband, Link Manager and optionally HCI.
  * an LE Controller including the LE PHY, Link Layer and optionally HCI.
  * a combined BR/EDR Controller portion and LE Controller portion into a single Controller.
  * may additionally have one or more Secondary Controllers.
