  ## A minimal implementation of BR/EDR

  * the four lowest layers associated protocols
  * one common service layer protocol
  * the Service Discovery Protocol (SDP)
  * the overal profile requirements defined in GAP.
</section>
<section data-markdown>
  ## A minimal implementation of LE

  * the four lowest layers and associated protocols.
  * two common service layer protocols
  * the Security Manager (SM)
  * Attribute Protocol (ATT)
  * the overall profile requirements specified in the GATT and GAP.
  
</section>
<section data-markdown>
  ## Core blocks

  * Link Manager, Link Controller and BR/EDR Radio blocks comprise a BR/EDR Controller.
  * An AMP PAL, AMP MAC, and AMP PHY comprise an AMP Controller.
  * Link Manager, Link Controller and LE Radio blocks comprise an LE Controller.
  
</section>
<section data-markdown>
  ## Core Blocks

  * L2CAP, SDP and GAP blocks comprise a BR/EDR Host.
  * L2CAP, SMP, Attribute protocol, GAP and Generic Attribute Profile (GATT) blocks comprise an LE Host.
  * A BR/EDR/LE Host combines the set of blocks from each respective Host.
  
</section>
<section data-markdown>
  ## Core System Protocols

  * Radio (PHY) protocol
  * Link Control (LC) and Link Manager (LM) protocol or Link Layer (LL) protocol
  * AMP PAL
  * Logical Link Control and Adaptation protocol (L2CAP)
  * AMP Manager Protocol.
  
</section>
<section data-markdown>
  ## Service Layer Protocols

  * Service Discovery Protocol (SDP)
  * Attribute Protocol (ATT)

  <h3>Service Types</h3>
  <ul>
    <li><span class="ppt-keyword">device control services</span>: modify the behavior and modes of a Bluetooth device.</li>
    <li><span class="ppt-keyword">transport control services</span>: create, modify and release traffic bearers (channels and links)</li>
    <li><span class="ppt-keyword">data services</span>: submit data for transmission over traffic bearers.</li>
  </ul>
</section>
<section data-markdown>
  ## Host Controller Interface (HCI)

  * the standard service interface between Controller and Host.
  * Implementation of this standard interface is optional.
  
</section>
<section data-markdown>
  ## L2CAP

  * it's assumed that the Controllers have limited data buffering capabilities compared with the Host.
  * L2CAP layer is expected to carry out some simple resource management when submitting data to Controller.
  * responsible for data segmentation and assembly, QoS commitments.
  
</section>
<section data-markdown>
  ## Reliable Communication

  * basic acknowledgment/repeat request (ARQ) protocol under Controllers.
  * The L2CAP layer can optionally provide a further error detection and retransmission.
  * The L2CAP layer can further optionally provide a window-based flow control in the receiving side.
