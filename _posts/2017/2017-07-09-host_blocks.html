  ## Channel Manager

  * responsible for creating, managing and closing L2CAP channels.
  * uses the L2CAP protocol to interact with a channel manager on a remote (peer) device to
  * create these L2CAP channels
  * connect their endpoints to the appropriate entities.

  ## Channel Manager

  * interacts with its local link manager or an AMP PAL to
  * create new logical links (if necessary)
  * configure these links to provide the required quality of service for the type of data being transported.

  ## L2CAP Resource Manager

  * managing the ordering of submission of PDU fragments to the baseband.
  * Schedule Resources to access the physical channel.
  * carry out traffic conformance policing to ensure negotiated QoS settings is met.

  ## Security Manager Protocol

  * the P2P protocol used to generate encryption keys and identity keys.
  * operates over a dedicated fixed L2CAP channel.
  * manages storage of the encryption keys and identity keys.
  * responsible for generating random addresses and resolving random addresses to known device identities.
  * only used in LE systems.

  ## Attribute Protocol

  * implements the peer-to-peer protocol between an attribute server and an attribute client.
  * communicate over a dedicated fixed L2CAP channel.
  * The ATT client sends commands, requests, and confirmations to the ATT server.
  * The ATT server sends responses, notifications and indications to the client.

  ## Generic Attribute Profile

  * represents the functionality of the attribute server and, optionally, the attribute client.
  * describes the hierarchy of services, characteristics and attributes used in the attribute server.
  * The block provides interfaces for discovering, reading, writing and indicating of service characteristics and attributes.
  * used on LE devices for LE profile service discovery.

  ## Generic Access Profile

  * represents the base functionality common to all Bluetooth devices.
  * GAP services include:
  * device discovery
  * connection modes
  * security
  * authentication
  * association models
  * service discovery
