  <h3>Bluetooth Basics</h3>
  <p>
    Bluetooth wireless technology is a short-range communications technology intended to replace the cables connecting portable and/or fixed devices while maintaining high levels of security.
  </p>
</section>
<section>
  <ul>
    <li>The key features of Bluetooth technology are</li>
    <ul>
      <li>Robustness</li>
      <li>Low Power</li>
      <li>Low Cost</li>
    </ul>
    <li>The Bluetooth specification defines a uniform structure for a wide range of devices to connect and communicate with each other.</li>
  </ul>
</section>
<section>
  <ul>
    <li>Any Bluetooth-enabled device can connect to other Bluetooth-enabled devices in proximity.</li>
    <li>Bluetooth devices connect and communicate wirelessly through piconets.</li>
    <li>Each device can simultaneously communicate with up to seven other devices within a single piconet. Each device can also belong to several piconets simultaneously.</li>
    <li>Piconets are established dynamically and automatically as Bluetooth-enabled devices enter and leave radio proximity.</li>
  </ul>
</section>
<section>
  <ul>
    <li>A fundamental Bluetooth wireless technology strength is the ability to simultaneously handle both data and voice transmissions.</li>
    <li>This enables users to enjoy variety of innovative solutions such as:</li>
    <ul>
      <li>A hands-free headset for voice calls</li>
      <li>Printing and fax capabilities</li>
      <li>Synchronizing PDA, laptop, and mobile phone applications</li>
    </ul>
  </ul>
</section>

  <h3>Specification Make-up</h3>
  <p>
    Unlike many other wireless standards, the Bluetooth wireless specification gives product developers both link layer and application layer definitions, which supports data and voice applications.
  </p>
</section>
<section>
  <h3>Spectrum</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Bluetooth technology operates in the unlicensed industrial, scientific, and medical (ISM) band at 2.4 to 2.485 GHz, using a spread spectrum, frequency hopping, full-duplex signal at a nominal rate of 1600 hops/sec.</li>
    <li>The 2.4 GHz ISM band is available and unlicensed in most countries.</li>
  </ul>
</section>
<section>
  <h3>Interference</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Adaptive frequency hopping (AFH) capability was designed to reduce interference between wireless technologies sharing the 2.4 GHz spectrum.</li>
    <li>AFH works within the spectrum to take advantage of the available frequency.</li>
    <li>This adaptive hopping allows for more efficient transmission within the spectrum.</li>
    <li>The signal hops among 79 frequencies at 1 MHz intervals.</li>
  </ul>
</section>
<section>
  <h3>Range</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>The operating range depends on the device class:</li>
    <ul>
      <li>Class 3 radios (0 dBm)– have a range of up to 1 meter or 3 feet</li>
      <li>Class 2 radios (4 dBm)– most commonly found in mobile devices – have a range of 10 meters or 30 feet</li>
      <li>Class 1 radios (20 dBm)– used primarily in industrial use cases – have a range of 100 meters or 300 feet</li>
    </ul>
  </ul>
</section>
<section>
  <h3>Power</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>The most commonly used radio is Class 2 and uses 2.5 mW of power.</li>
    <li>Bluetooth technology is designed to have very low power consumption.</li>
  </ul>
</section>
<section>
  <h3>Data Rate</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>1 Mbps for Version 1.2</li>
    <li>Up to 3 Mbps supported for Version 2.0/2.1 + EDR</li>
  </ul>
</section>

  <h3>How Bluetooth Technology Works</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Overview of Operation</li>
    <li>Core System Architecture</li>
    <li>Communication Topology</li>
    <li>Profiles Overview</li>
  </ul>
</section>
<section>
  <h3>Overview of Operation</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>The Bluetooth RF (physical layer) operates in the unlicensed ISM band at 2.4 GHz.</li>
    <li>The system employs a frequency hop transceiver.</li>
    <li>RF operation uses a shaped, binary frequency modulation.</li>
    <li>The symbol rate is 1 Megasymbol per second (Msps) supporting the bit rate of 1 Megabit per second (Mbps) or, with Enhanced Data Rate, a gross air bit rate of 2 or 3Mb/s.</li>
  </ul>
</section>
<section>
  <ul>
    <li>A physical radio channel is shared by a group of devices that are synchronized to a common clock and frequency hopping pattern.</li>
    <li>One device provides the synchronization reference and is known as the master. All other devices are known as slaves.</li>
    <li>A group of devices synchronized in this fashion form a piconet.</li>
  </ul>
</section>
<section>
  <ul>
    <li>Devices in a piconet use a specific frequency hopping pattern.</li>
    <li>The basic hopping pattern is a pseudo-random ordering of the 79 frequencies in the ISM band.</li>
    <li>The hopping pattern may be adapted to exclude a portion of the frequencies that are used by interfering devices.</li>
    <li>The adaptive hopping technique improves Bluetooth technology co-existence with static (non-hopping) ISM systems when these are co-located.</li>
  </ul>
</section>
<section>
  <ul>
    <li>The physical channel is subdivided into time units known as <span class="ppt-keyword">slots</span>.</li>
    <li>Data is transmitted in packets that are positioned in these slots.</li>
    <li>A number of consecutive slots may be allocated to a single packet.</li>
    <li>Frequency hopping takes place between the transmission or reception of packets.</li>
  </ul>
</section>
<section>
  <ul>
    <li>Above the physical channel there is a layering of links and channels and associated control protocols.</li>
    <li>The hierarchy of channels and links from the physical channel upwards is</li>
    <ul>
      <li>Physical channel</li>
      <li>Physical link</li>
      <li>Logical transport</li>
      <li>Logical link</li>
      <li>L2CAP channel</li>
    </ul>
  </ul>
</section>
<section>
  <ul>
    <li>Within a physical channel, a physical link is formed between any two devices that transmit packets in either direction between them.</li>
    <li>In a piconet physical channel, there are restrictions on which devices may form a physical link.</li>
    <li>There is a physical link between each slave and the master.</li>
    <li>Physical links are not formed directly between the slaves in a piconet.</li>
  </ul>
</section>
<section>
  <ul>
    <li>The physical link is used as a transport for one or more logical links.</li>
    <li>Traffic on logical links is multiplexed onto the physical link by occupying slots assigned by a scheduling function in the resource manager.</li>
  </ul>
</section>
<section>
  <ul>
    <li>A control protocol for the baseband and physical layers is carried over logical links in addition to user data. This is the <span class="ppt-keyword">link manager protocol (LMP)</span>.</li>
    <li>Devices that are active in a piconet have a default asynchronous connection-oriented logical transport that is used to transport the LMP protocol signaling. For historical reasons, this is known as the <span class="ppt-keyword">ACL logical transport</span>.</li>
    <li>The default ACL logical transport is the one that is created whenever a device joins a piconet.</li>
  </ul>
</section>
<section>
  <ul>
    <li>The link manager function uses LMP to control the operation of devices in the piconet.</li>
    <li>The LMP protocol is only carried on the default ACL logical transport and the default broadcast logical transport.</li>
  </ul>
</section>
<section>
  <ul>
    <li>Above the baseband layer, the L2CAP layer provides a channel-based abstraction to applications and services.</li>
    <li>It carries out segmentation and reassembly of application data and multiplexing and de-multiplexing of multiple channels over a shared logical link.</li>
    <li>L2CAP has a protocol control channel that is carried over the default ACL logical transport.</li>
    <li>Application data submitted to the L2CAP protocol may be carried on any logical link that supports the L2CAP protocol.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>What is BT HS Technology?</h3>
  <div class="ppt">
    <div class="ppt-left">
      <ul>
        <li>The BT HS technology has the capability to switch over to an 802.11 radio for fast data transfer.</li>
        <li>The BT core is able to dynamically select the right controller, BR/EDR or AMP, under the L2CAP layer for any job.</li>
        <li>BR/EDR, the primary controller, is used to perform discovery, association, connection establishment, and connection maintenance.</li>
      </ul>
    </div>
    <div class="ppt-right">
      <ul>
        <li>AMP, the secondary controller, is used for fast data transfer; up to 24 Mbps throughput rate.</li>
        <li>In addition, mobile devices, including BT 3.0, will realize increased power savings due to enhanced built-in power control.</li>
        <li>BT 3.0 + HS is completely backwards compatible with older BT devices, and still uses the same protocols for establishing connections.</li>
